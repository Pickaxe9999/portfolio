AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's 
deployed portfolio of work samples


SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess 
whether they're a good candidate for an open position



GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, 
and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them


WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section


WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications


WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others


WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application


WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


Description - website is a simple mock porfolio home page for possible recruiters
